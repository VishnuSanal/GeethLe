# GeethLe (à¤—à¥€à¤¤ à¤²à¥‡)

### What?

A simple service to search for music from anywhere

### Why?

Sooo, assume you're talking to someone over WhatsApp & want to mention about a song. And, ofcourse you're too lazy to go find the link. :D Don't worry, I have your back!

```https://geethle.onrender.com/search/<query>```

Append your search query & it finds the track, generates a custom thumbnail with metadata + it redirects to Spotify once you click on the link. ðŸ™‚

### Anything else?

- ```https://geethle.onrender.com/yt/<youtube-id>```
- ```https://geethle.onrender.com/sp/<spotify-id>```

Basically the same thing, but with IDs.

### Credits

- Uses the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/) to fetch music metadata.
- Uses [Odesli API](https://odesli.co/) to get the Spotify ID from YouTube ID.
