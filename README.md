## Forget the Search, Play the Vibe!

### What?

A simple service to search for music from anywhere

### Why?

Sooo, assume you're talking to someone over WhatsApp & want to mention about a song. And, ofcourse you're too lazy to go find the link. :D Don't worry, I have your back!

```https://geethle.onrender.com/<query>```

Append your search query & it finds the track, generates a custom thumbnail with metadata + it redirects to Spotify once you click on the link. ðŸ™‚

### Anything else?

#### Get links to Spotify with:

- ```https://geethle.onrender.com/sp/<query>```
- ```https://geethle.onrender.com/spotify/<query>```

#### Get links to Youtube with:

- ```https://geethle.onrender.com/yt/<query>```
- ```https://geethle.onrender.com/youtube/<query>```

#### Get links to Youtube Music with:

- ```https://geethle.onrender.com/youtubemusic/<query>```
  
#### Get the details and redirection using Youtube/Spotify IDs:
