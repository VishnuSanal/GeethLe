# GeethLe (à¤—à¥€à¤¤ à¤²à¥‡) - Search for Songs from **Anywhere**!

### What?

GeethLe makes sharing music easy! Search for any song from anywhere with geethle.me/<your+fav+song> and instantly get a permalink to the song along with a thumbnail with metadata. Itâ€™ll redirect you to your favorite music provider, saving time when sharing tracks.

Sooo, say you're talking to someone over WhatsApp & want to mention about a song. And, you're too lazy to go find the link. :D Don't worry, I have your back!
